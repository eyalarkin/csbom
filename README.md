# csbom cli tool

This is a cli tool that parses an SBOM outputted by Scribe Security valint tool, formatted as CycloneDX, and creates a csv file containing the following.

### Installation

**Notice:** the tool is still in development, therefore it is suggested not to install it directly to your PATH. Instead, you could create a virtual python environment using python's [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) tool.

With this tool, you can create an environment with the command `virtualenv <env_name>`. virtualenv will create a directory in your current directory named `<env_name>`.

To activate your environment, on Linux/Mac you can run `source <env_name>/bin/activate` and on windows, `.\env_name\Scripts\activate`

To exit the environment, run `deactivate` and your terminal should go back to normal.

While in the venv, do this to install (this way, the tool will only be installed in the virtual environment):

Using the python package manager, run `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ csbom==0.0.1`
